# 🧪 Demo Portfolio Website (HTML/CSS/JS)

This is a lightweight **demo version** of my personal portfolio website, built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a prototype before developing the final version using **Next.js** and modern tooling.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

- Quickly prototype the layout, structure, and styling of the portfolio.
- Test responsive behavior and basic interactivity.
- Serve as a visual and design foundation for the final version.
- Provide a lightweight fallback version with zero dependencies.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – semantic and accessible structure.
- **CSS3** – responsive styling with media queries and animations.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – minimal interactivity (e.g., navigation toggle, scroll behavior).

---

## 📦 Features

- Responsive mobile-first design.
- Smooth scrolling and simple CSS animations.
- Sticky navigation with active link highlighting.
- About, Projects, Contact, and other key sections.
- Placeholder contact form (non-functional).
- Fully static—no build tools or frameworks.
